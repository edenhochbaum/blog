# Why Github?

Glad you asked!  I wanted to control my own content, and use my local tools of
choice and git.  I didn't want to write a lot of HTML or CSS, so markdown
seemed like a natural choice.  Github lets me do all of that and host it for
free and not have to think about it much.  Maybe some day I will move onto
Medium or something, get RSS support, tags, and a bunch of other nice stuff,
but it seems like overkill for now.
